              <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead">
                The Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is an architectural masterpiece and one of the most iconic landmarks in Mysore, Karnataka, India. 
                It stands as a testament to the city's royal heritage and grandeur. The original Mysore Palace was constructed in the 14th century but was destroyed and rebuilt several times. 
                The current palace was commissioned by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV and designed by British architect Henry Irwin. Construction began in 1897 and was completed in 1912. 
                The palace is an exquisite example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, which blends Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic styles.

              <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead">
                The palace showcases a harmonious fusion of various architectural elements. 
                It features a three-storied stone structure with a stunning facade adorned with intricate carvings, arches, and domes. 
                The palace is surrounded by a large courtyard and has several gateways, including the magnificent Gombe Thotti (Doll's Pavilion) and Balarama Gate. 
                The Durbar Hall, with its ornate ceiling and stained glass work, is the centerpiece of the palace.

              <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead">
                The palace spans an area of about 245,000 square feet and consists of several courtyards, gardens, and buildings. 
                The interiors of the palace are equally captivating, featuring elaborately decorated halls, corridors, and rooms. 
                The walls are adorned with beautiful murals depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, portraits of the Wadiyar dynasty, and intricate floral patterns. 
                The palace also houses a remarkable collection of antique furniture, royal artifacts, and treasures.

                The throne is made of gold and was used by the rulers during important ceremonies. 
                Adjacent to the throne room is the Ambavilasa, a grand hall where the royal family held private audience and receptions. 
                The hall is known for its splendid chandeliers, ornate pillars, and intricate artwork.

                The annual Dasara festival, celebrated with great pomp and show, attracts thousands of visitors. 
                The palace becomes the focal point of the festivities, with a grand procession and cultural performances taking place in its vicinity. A portion of the palace has been converted into a museum, showcasing a vast collection of royal memorabilia. 
                The museum displays weapons, costumes, musical instruments, paintings, and other artifacts that offer insights into the history and lifestyle of the Wadiyar dynasty.

                Brindavan Gardens was constructed in the year 1927 under the rule of Sir Mirza Ismail, the then Diwan of Mysore. 
                It was designed by Sir Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar, an eminent architect. The inspiration for the garden's design comes from the Mughal style of architecture, particularly the Shalimar Gardens of Kashmir.

                It is about 23 kilometers away from the city of Mysore. The garden is divided into two parts: the main garden and the terrace garden. 
                The main garden is characterized by expansive lawns, flower beds, and symmetrically arranged pathways. 
                The terrace garden is located one level above and features fountains, pavilions, and terraces with cascading water channels.
